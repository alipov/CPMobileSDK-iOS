/**
 This is a convenience function for quick integration with the SDK. Call this function in your @c main function instead of @c UIApplicationMain.
 
 
 The function is called in the main entry point to create the application object and the application delegate and set up the event cycle. Internally, @c CPMobileSDK.startSDKWithOptions(_:) is called to start the SDK with the provided options. Once the system is ready and the user has unlocked the application, the application delegate will start receiving normal application life cycle method calls.

 @param argc               The count of arguments in @c argv; this usually is the corresponding parameter to @c main.
 @param argv               A variable list of arguments; this usually is the corresponding parameter to @c main.
 @param principalClassName The name of the @c UIApplication class or subclass. If you specify @c nil, the value for @c NSPrincipalClass from the Info.plist is used. If there is no @c NSPrincipalClass key specified, the @c UIApplication class is used.
 @param delegateClassName  The name of the class from which the application delegate is instantiated. If @c principalClassName designates a subclass of @c UIApplication, you may designate the subclass as the delegate; the subclass instance receives the application-delegate messages. Specify @c nil if you load the delegate object from your application’s main nib file. The delegate class will be instantiated using @c init.
 @param SDKOptions         An options object, defining the behavior of the mobile SDK.
 
 @return Even though an integer return type is specified, this function never returns.
